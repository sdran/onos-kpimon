# onos-kpimon
The xApplication for ONOS SD-RAN (ÂµONOS Architecture) to monitor KPI

## Overview
The `onos-kpimon` is the xApplication running over ONOS SD-RAN to monitor the KPI.
As of now, it monitors the number of active UEs in the Radio Access Network (RAN) connected to the ONOS SD-RAN.
Since ONOS SD-RAN has multiple micro-services running on the Kubernetes platform, `onos-kpimon` can run on the Kubernetes along with other ONOS SD-RAN micro-services.
In order to deploy `onos-kpimon`, a Helm chart is necessary, which is in the [`sdran-helm-charts`](https://github.com/onosproject/sdran-helm-charts) repository.
Note that this application should be running together with the other SD-RAN micro-services (e.g., `Atomix`, `onos-e2t`, `onos-e2sub`, and `onos-sdran-cli`).
Easily, `sd-ran` umbrella chart can be used to deploy all essential micro-services and `onos-kpimon`. 

## Interaction with the other ONOS SD-RAN micro-services
To begin with, `onos-kpimon` sends a subscription message to [`onos-e2sub`](https://github.com/onosproject/onos-e2sub) to receives E2 indication messages through [`onos-ric-sdk-go` library](https://github.com/onosproject/onos-ric-sdk-go).
When the subscription is finished successfully, `onos-kpimon` application starts to get E2 indication messages from E2 node, such as `CU-CP`, through [`onos-e2t`](https://github.com/onosproject/onos-e2t).
Then, `onos-kpimon` decodes each indication message by using E2 KPM service model which is defined in [`onos-e2-sm` plugin](https://github.com/onosproject/onos-e2-sm).
The monitoring result can be shown with the CLI through [`onos-sdran-cli`](https://github.com/onosproject/onos-cli).
`onos-kpimon` sends the monitoring result to the `onos-sdran-cli` through gRPC protocol defined in [`onos-api`](https://github.com/onosproject/onos/api) repository.

## Command Line Interface
### Show the number of UEs
Go to the CLI micro-service pod, and command below:
```bash
$ sdran kpimon list numues
Key[PLMNID, nodeID]                       num(Active UEs)
{eNB-CU-Eurecom-LTEBox [0 2 16] 57344}   1
```
